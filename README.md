# react-native-youtube-app EC Short Assignment

I had a great time making this, as it was really cool to see how easily our React knowledge transferred over to mobile dev.

There is no hosted app (because it's mobile), so download the code, `npm install`, run `expo start`, and open in browser or in expo app to see the result. Thanks!!
