Have fun!

## Acknowledgments

Some of the work for this project was started by Sudharsan Balasubrami '22 (Tri Kap) and Maria Roodnitsky '22 (❤️) during COSC 65 (Smartphone Programming) during 20S. Since then, many people have touched this project, Dartmouth students and non-Dartmouth students alike. We give thanks to everyone who has listened to our ideas, offered their advice, and provided a window into their own invaluable experiences. 

Thank you to the following:
